# ImageClassification
Models suitable for image classification

To choose and implement a suitable machine learning model for an image classification task, we should consider several factors, such as the complexity of the images, the size of the dataset, and the computational resources available. Here’s a high-level overview of three common models suitable for image classification:
## 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Strengths: Excellent for image data due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies. They are the go-to models for image classification tasks.
Weaknesses: Require a lot of data and computational power. Training can be time-consuming.

## 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Strengths: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Works well with a clear margin of separation.
Weaknesses: Not as effective when the data set is very large or has noise.

## 3. Random Forest
Strengths: Good at handling a mix of data types and provides a measure of feature importance. Can handle a large number of features and data points.
Weaknesses: May not perform as well as CNNs on complex image classification tasks

Given that image classification tasks often benefit most from the spatial understanding provided by CNNs, I will implement a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Steps for Implementation
1. Load and Preprocess the Data: Ensure the images are of consistent size and normalize pixel values.
2. Build the CNN Model: Design a suitable architecture with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
3. Compile the Model: Choose an optimizer and loss function suitable for classification.
4. Train the Model: Use the training dataset to fit the model.
5. Evaluate the Model: Assess the model’s performance using a validation or test dataset.
